## How to Develop

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser,
using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

You can start editing the popup by modifying `popup.tsx`. It should auto-update as you make changes. To add an options
page, simply add a `options.tsx` file to the root of the project, with a react component default exported. Likewise to
add a content page, add a `content.ts` file to the root of the project, importing some module and do some logic, then
reload the extension on your browser.

For further guidance, [visit our Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

### Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.

### Submit to the webstores

The easiest way to deploy your Plasmo extension is to use the built-in [bpp](https://bpp.browser.market) GitHub action.
Prior to using this action however, make sure to build your extension and upload the first version to the store to
establish the basic credentials. Then, simply
follow [this setup instruction](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/submit) and you should be on your way for
automated submission!
